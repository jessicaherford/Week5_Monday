// ***You will need to add the necessary script tags for jQuery and grocery.js to index.html***

$(document).ready(function(){


  var groceries = [
    {name: "Tomatoes", status: "needed", price: "3.99", quantity: 5},
    {name: "Onions", status: "needed", price: "1.85", quantity: 2},
    {name: "Cilantro", status: "needed", price: ".95", quantity: 1},
    {name: "Limes", status: "complete", price: ".33", quantity: 3},
    {name: "Jalapeno", status: "complete", price: ".15", quantity: 2}
  ];
//1. Add groceries to <ul>. Store status, price and quantity as data attributes
//$("#list").append("<li class='listItem' data-status='' data-price='' data-quantity='' > <h2>"+groceries[i].name+ +groceries[i].price+"</h2> </li>");


for(i=0;i<groceries.length; i++){
  $("#list").append("<li class='listItem' data-status= 'groceries[i].status' data-price='groceries[i].price' data-quantity='groceries[i].price'> <h2>"+groceries[i].name+"  "+groceries[i].price+" "+groceries[i].quantity+"</h2> </li>");
}

//Youâ€™ll need to fill in the status, price and quantity similar to how I did with the name

//2. Give 'needed' items a background-color of your choosing. Do the same for 'complete' items.
//   Choose any text color you desire.

//3. Display the item quantity next to it's name. (  i.e. Tomatoes (5)  )

//4. Display total quantity and cost on the page.

//5. When an item is hovered over, it's background should darken slightly. This can be done through CSS but use
//   JS for practice.

//6. When and item is double-clicked, give it the class 'selected' and have it's background remain slightly darkened.

//7. When 'Remove Item' is clicked, delete the item from the list. Have the item .fadeOut()

//8. When 'Add item' is clicked, a new item should be added to the list. 'Status' should default as 'needed'.

//9. ** Have total quantity and cost update when items are added or removed!

//10. Add a new item with a status called 'splurge'. Any 'splurge' items should have a $$$ before the name and a
//    unique background-color.

//11. Create a 'Tighten Budget' button that removes all splurged items from the list.

//12. Add a <span> to each of your <li> items with a Plus Glyphicon (http://getbootstrap.com/components/). When
//    this is clicked the item should expand down to reveal it's price and quantity.

//13. **BONUS** Incorporate a new property called 'description' and display it however you prefer.
